# Note Taker: Brainy Notes!
![license badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen)

## Description

In this Module 11 Challenge, we were tasked to create a "Note Taker" application to write, save & delete notes - NOT using local storage! Rather, an express.js back-end database that saved and retrieved the notes from a JSON file. Now that's a brainy way to keep notes! You can access the note taker, deployed with Heroku, here: [Brainy Notes!](https://boiling-scrubland-64436.herokuapp.com/)

## Installation

To install necessary dependencies, run the following command: 
```
npm i
```

## Usage

To use this note taker app, simply take your notes (make sure to give them an informative title!), and when you're done, click save - the floppy disk at the top righthand side of the page. You can come back to them and edit them as you wish, because your notes are stored in a database :)
